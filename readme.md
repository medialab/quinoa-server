# WIP - quinoa server

``quinoa-server`` is a node application providing diverse back-end services for quinoa apps.

It is supposed to provide three services :

* converting quinoa presentations and stories to ready-to-archive (and use) all-in-one html files for these presentations and stories
* serving a ``REST API`` interface to locally stored quinoa presentations and stories, enabling to list, filter, read, update, create and delete these locally stored documents
* interfacing an app with Github in the Github ``oAuth`` authentication process

To see with which front-end applications this application works and how they play together see :

* [bulgur - presentations making application](https://github.com/medialab/bulgur)
* [fonio - stories making application](https://github.com/medialab/fonio)


For now test server is there : https://quinoa-server-nepntvogdo.now.sh
